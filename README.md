# Hybrid-cryptography-model-to-enhance-security-in-cloud
This combines various cryptographic algorithms such as RSA with a digital signature, SHA-3, and Brotli. This is a hybrid approach where RSA with a digital signature is used for confidentiality and authentication, hashing is done by SHA-3 and Brotli will be used for compression.
